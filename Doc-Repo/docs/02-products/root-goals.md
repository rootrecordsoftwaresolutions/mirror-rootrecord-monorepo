# Root Goals

**Root Goals** helps people define outcomes, break them into trackable steps, and get an AI-generated plan from their own inputs. **Root Goals 1.0.0 · Release 0** is the first versioned foundation.

## What problem it solves

- **Clarity** — Turn vague intentions into a named goal with purpose, steps, and timeline.
- **Persistence before signup** — Guest-first onboarding saves drafts via `X-Guest-Id` / `device_id` until the user creates an account.
- **AI plan** — Grok generates a summary, plan steps, **Actions**, and **Suggestions** from full goal context (multi-pass when validation fails).
- **Progress tracking** — Achievements, notes, costs, and income entries while working the goal.
- **Public sharing** — Optional public goals at custodial Solana address URLs on marketing site and `goals.rootrecord.info`.

## How it talks to the cloud

Clients call **`rootrecord-api-goals`** (`https://api-goals.rootrecord.info/api` in production; Workers dev URL for Pages until custom domain is attached). Authenticated routes use Bearer token or SSO cookie; drafts and pre-auth flows use **`X-Guest-Id`**.

Public read-only routes: `GET /public/:address/goals` and `GET /public/:address/goals/:slug`.

## AI disclaimer

Root Record does **not** provide financial support or advice. **Actions** and **Suggestions** are AI-generated and may not reflect Root Record's core beliefs. Use your own judgment.
